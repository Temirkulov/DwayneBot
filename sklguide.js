**What are prestige points and what do they do?**
> **Prestige points** are a form of currency in IdleCap that are **not purchased** but rather **accumulated** through increasing your money, or what is in your balance. 
> When you first start out, $12,000 dollars translates to one prestige point. Prestige points are **given after a user prestiges**, and can be used to buy boosts until your next prestige.
