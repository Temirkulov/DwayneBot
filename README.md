# DwayneBot - A Discord.JS helper bot

This was one of my early side projects where I dived into Javascript/Discord.JS and made a Discord Bot to help with calculations to provide statistics and profile analysis of user's game data in another huge discord bot called IdleCapitalist.

I mainly made use of Discord.JS version 12 where slash (/) commands have not been implemented yet. It reads data in embeds and stores them in an SQLite format and then sends out its analysis of user's data. All data stored is public and strictly relating to the game data only. 

This code served as a learning experience into JavaScript then anything else.
